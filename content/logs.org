Question:
#+begin_quote
In the context of supervised fine-tuning of an LLM, what kinds of "labels" may
be applied to input data, other than simple binary "correct" and "incorrect"?
#+end_quote
Answer (Claude 3.5 Sonnet):
#+begin_quote
Let me explain the different types of labels commonly used in supervised fine-tuning of LLMs:

- *Quality/Performance Scores*:
  - Numerical ratings (e.g., 1-5 scale) assessing response quality
  - Multiple dimensions like accuracy, coherence, relevance, and helpfulness
  - Expert-assigned grades or rubric-based scores
- *Behavioral Classifications*:
  - Toxicity levels and content safety ratings
  - Style markers (formal/informal, technical/simple)
  - Sentiment classifications
  - Task-specific categories (e.g., question type, reasoning approach used)
- *Alignment-Related Labels*:
  - Helpfulness measures
  - Truthfulness/factual accuracy scores
  - Ethical adherence ratings
  - Bias assessments
- *Structural/Format Labels*:
  - Response length appropriateness
  - Writing style consistency
  - Format compliance (e.g., following specified templates)
  - Language register appropriateness
- *Task-Specific Performance Metrics*:
  - Math problem-solving accuracy
  - Code functionality scores
  - Translation quality metrics
  - Reasoning step completeness
- *Human Preference Data*:
  - Ranked preferences between multiple outputs
  - A/B comparison results
  - Human feedback on specific aspects
  - Direct reward modeling signals
- *Meta-Labels*:
  - Confidence scores
  - Uncertainty measurements
  - Required expertise level
  - Context relevance ratings

The key is that these labels can be combined and weighted differently depending on the specific fine-tuning objectives.

Some old notes I jotted when I was first trying to get into poetry:
- get a feel for the style and length of verse (usually iambic pentameter/hexameter)
- try vocalising the words, emphasising their rhythm and percussion
- read slowly, as if you have all day to get through one stanza
- pay small emphasis on the last syllable of each verse
- commas are often used to help delineate rhythmic feet/units; apostrophes are often used to excise syllables; ellipses are often used to excise words
- read the poem twice (at least)

I've come up with a principle: For any proposition that would be made about
LLMs, the analogue of that proposition that applies to minds and societies
ought to be considered first.  This is not necessarily to serve as a defense
of LLMs, but I see many critiques online (most which I've forgotten) that can
be swiftly dismissed or at least improved upon by first considering this
principle.  Some examples:

"No-one knows how they work." --- Nor does anyone know how the brain works,
and yet they can be interacted with and are exceptionally useful all the same.

"ChatGPT is a blurry jpeg of the web." --- Talk to any homebody who spends
most of their time in front of a screen.

"LLMs are just stochastic parrots." --- This probably needs no elaboration.

"They're incapable of true creativity." --- A little more controversial here,
but this is making the /reductio ad absurdum/ argument which assumes humans /are/
capable of true creativity as something irreducible, arising from pure
inspiration.  I don't necessarily agree with that, but I would still concede
that LLMs are capable of only a crude kind of creativity.  On the other hand,
I think the notion of creativity is value-laden.  Perhaps we should ask
Prometheus what he thinks.

"Something something sociopathic." --- The corporate drone, whose behaviour is
constrained by the law rather than a set of moral principles, is a kind of
sociopath.  We haven't yet figured out a way to hardwire human values into a
model's biology.

"Something something hallucinations." --- Leaving any critical decisions up to
one person will run into the same risk.

"Something something finite context window."

Etc.

A bunch of old quotes and random musings that were perhaps too short for
separate posts:
- "Don't talk to me or my self ever again." üë®‚Äçüë¶
- I am, therefore I think.
- There's no such thing as always good advice, viz. universally applicable for
  all persons in all circumstances. (Obviously, that includes /this/ advice.)
- One can never see the ground directly under their feet.
- I want what is my own to be universal.  I want what is universal to be my
  own.
- Some other quotes (not mine) that I loved:
  - "Anxiety expands to occupy the space it's allowed to."
  - "Concepts are bundled at the level of maximum abstraction that's useful."
  - "One speaks in defence of things they fear are the least defensible."
- I feel like noise music is the most zen of all music.[fn::Unless you think
  silence counts as music, but I won't believe you unless you literally have
  John Cage's 4‚Äô33‚Äù in your playlist.]  Why?  Because, at its extreme, it
  converges towards silence.  When you listen to noise music, the act of
  actually /listening/ requires a kind of mindfulness of the present moment,
  where memory-of-the-past and anticipation-of-the-future hold the least
  bearing on how the immediate is experienced.  Amidst noise, it is /silence/
  that is deafening.
- Something else that occurred to me was noise music's similarity to inclement
  weather.  My pet theory is that the cosiness we tend to feel when taking
  shelter from a storm, as though wrapped in a blanket, is perhaps in part
  because it is a time when predators (i.e., other humans) are less likely to
  be roaming about. (I've done literally zero research on this though. Someone
  I know said they think it's because a storm portends the availability of
  water.)  Perhaps the analogue for noise is the threat of our own thoughts.
- Why aren't ethicists more ethical?  To this I would respond by asking why we
  would expect it to be so; whether we are as in control of our thoughts and
  actions as we have led ourselves to believe.
- It feels unfair that the business world should have a better understanding
  of a person's psychology than the person does of themselves (with regard to
  marketing, public relations, lobbying, etc.).  It seems like wage-slavery,
  but applied to the psychological domain; if one does not possess the freedom
  to choose otherwise, they cannot be said to consent to begin with.
- The saying "No one is an island" extends to our dependency on society for
  recognition.  My desire for independence reaffirms my dependency on what I
  wish to stand apart from.  It is through the sacrifice of our particularity
  that we reconnect with the universal.  The desire for independence taken to
  its logical conclusion would be a desire for complete alienation, to become
  a pure contingency.  But who would desire this?

[[https://orbistertius.substack.com/p/glimmers-now-the-afterglow][This piece]] was a light-bulb moment for understanding entropy.

Minimum entropy = interestingness, or in my words, /intelligibility/.

Maximum entropy = diffuseness, /unintelligibility/.

I wanted to say that negentropy is /simplicity/, but that would be begging the
question.  Entropy is not mind-independent, and there is no mind-independent
way to define simplicity.  /Intelligibility/ is an explicitly mind-dependent
concept.

This raises a further question for me though.  Namely, if we accept the "arrow
of time" as being a result of entropy, and entropy is mind-dependent, then
this means the arrow of time is mind-dependent --- that there's nothing
objectively necessary about its direction.

Someone asked the question: Why is integration harder than differentiation?

I haven't had to solve a calculus problem since university days, and I don't
recall one set of problems being "harder" than the other.  Mostly I just
recall their conceptual meanings, that they are inverse operations, and that
integration requires a constant term.

Perhaps the answers will illuminate the meaning of the question?

[[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/20578/why-is-integration-so-much-harder-than-differentiation/20636#20636][Answer]]:
#+begin_quote
Here is an extremely generic answer.  Differentiation is a "local" operation:
to compute the derivative of a function at a point you only have to know how
it behaves in a neighborhood of that point.  But integration is a "global"
operation: to compute the definite integral of a function in an interval you
have to know how it behaves on the /entire/ interval (and to compute the
indefinite integral you have to know how it behaves on /all/ intervals).  That is
a lot of information to summarise.  Generally, local things are much easier
than global things.

On the other hand, if you can do the global things, they tend to be /useful/
because of how much information goes into them.  That's why theorems like the
fundamental theorem of calculus, the full form of Stokes' theorem, and the
main theorems of complex analysis are so powerful: they let us calculate
global things in terms of slightly less global things.

From Roger Penrose (/Road To Reality/):
#+begin_verse
... there is a striking contrast between the operations of differentiation and integration, in this calculus, with regard to which is the "easy" one and which is the "difficult" one.  When it is a matter of applying the operations to explicit formulae involving known functions, it is differentiation which is "easy" and integration "difficult", and in many cases the latter may not be possible to carry out at all in an explicit way.  On the other hand, when functions are not given in terms of formulae, but are provided in the form of tabulated lists of numerical data, then it is integration which is "easy" and differentiation "difficult", and the latter may not, strictly speaking, be possible at all in the ordinary way.  Numerical techniques are generally concerned with approximations, but there is also a close analogue of this aspect of things in the exact theory, and again it is integration which can be performed in circumstances where differentiation cannot.

In the MIT lecture 6.001 "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"
by Sussman and Abelson this contrast is briefly discussed in terms of pattern
matching:

#+begin_verse
And you know from calculus that it's easy to produce derivatives of arbitrary expressions.  You also know from your elementary calculus that it's hard to produce integrals.  Yet integrals and derivatives are opposites of each other.  They're inverse operations.  And they have the same rules.  What is special about these rules that makes it possible for one to produce derivatives easily and integrals why it's so hard?  Let's think about that very simply.

Look at these rules.  Every one of these rules, when used in the direction for taking derivatives, which is in the direction of this arrow, the left side is matched against your expression, and the right side is the thing which is the derivative of that expression.  The arrow is going that way.  In each of these rules, the expressions on the right-hand side of the rule that are contained within derivatives are subexpressions, are proper subexpressions, of the expression on the left-hand side.

So here we see [that the derivative of a sum is a sum of the derivatives of its summands].  So the rule of moving to the right are reduction rules.  The problem becomes easier.  I turn a big complicated problem into lots of smaller problems and then combine the results, a perfect place for recursion to work.

If I'm going in the other direction like this, if I'm trying to produce integrals, well there are several problems you see here.  First of all, if I try to integrate an expression like a sum, more than one rule matches.  Here's one that matches.  Here's one that matches.  I don't know which one to take.  And they may be different.  I may get to explore different things.  Also, the expressions become larger in that direction.  And when the expressions become larger, then there's no guarantee that any particular path I choose will terminate, because we will only terminate by accidental cancellation.  So that's why integrals are complicated searches and hard to do.

A binary relation is a subset of the set of ordered pairs between two sets
(which could be the same set).  In other words, it is defined as a subset of a
cartesian product: $R \subseteq X \times Y$.

Thus a relation could be thought of as a kind of carving out of the space of
possibility, such that an inference can be made about one element given
another in the same pair.

Note that this simple definition does not imply symmetry, that $x \sim y \iff
y \sim x$.  As such, the term "relation" does not necessarily imply
bidirectionality.  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory][category theory]], a relation is represented by a directed
arrow.  It seems as though the directed arrow as a concept cannot be broken
down further; is prior to, or a component of, the concept of symmetry; is
fundamental to relation /qua/ idea.  However, in casual use one may consider it
bidirectional in the sense of there being implied a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposite_category][dual category]] (e.g. the
$\ge$ relation has $\lt$ as its dual).

I consider this because it seems as though, when an object comes into
consciousness, semantically adjacent objects invariably come to mind as well.
For example, "gambling" brings to mind (or perhaps "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)][primes]]") "sport", but so
too does "sport" bring to mind "gambling".[fn::I hate how [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_in_Australia][Australian]] this
example is.]  One can think of connections between neurons as being binary
relations; from this view, "semantic adjecency" would be a symmetric relation.
This lead me to ask:
#+begin_quote
It has been said that "neurons that fire together wire together".  Does this
mean that most neuronal connections in the brain are bidirectional?
#+end_quote

ChatGPT:
#+begin_quote
The phrase "neurons that fire together wire together" refers to Hebbian
theory, which suggests that when two neurons are active at the same time, the
connection between them strengthens. This concept doesn't necessarily imply
that most neuronal connections in the brain are bidirectional.

Neuronal connections can indeed be bidirectional in some cases, especially in
networks where information flows back and forth between neurons. However, not
all connections are bidirectional. In many cases, neuronal connections are
unidirectional, meaning they transmit information in one direction only.

For instance, in a typical neural pathway, information flows from one neuron
(the presynaptic neuron) to another (the postsynaptic neuron) across a
synapse. This flow of information is unidirectional, with signals transmitted
from the presynaptic neuron to the postsynaptic neuron.

While bidirectional connections do exist, they are not the majority in the
brain. The brain's structural and functional complexity arises from a
combination of unidirectional and bidirectional connections among neurons and
neural networks. Both types of connections contribute to information
processing, learning, and memory formation in the brain.

[As Wittgenstein points out,] phenomenological propositions are not verifiable
at all.  It makes no sense to ask how "I have toothache" is verified.  "How do
you know that you have toothache?" is a nonsense question.  The two standard
ploys of those who take the pseudo-question to be a genuine question with a
trivial answer are misguided.  "I know I have pain because I feel it" is
vacuous because "I feel pain" and "I have pain" have the same meaning.  "I
know by introspection" is wrong because it erroneously suggests a perceptual
model of inner sense.  I cannot look and see whether I have pain.  [I merely
infer from an observation of pain behaviour occurring in this body.]
#+end_quote

ch. 10.2:
#+begin_quote
The Cartesian picture of self-consciousness or self-awareness neither
originates with Descartes nor is it adopted only by those who embrace the
doctrines propounded by him.  But it was he who articulated this conception
with mesmerising brilliance; hence it may justly be denominated "Cartesian".
Each person sees, hears, and feels objects in his vicinity, experiences joy or
sorrow, suffers pain or grief.  He thinks, believes, doubts, or is certain,
has purposes and intentions.  If we ask someone what he perceives, thinks, or
intends, whether he is in pain or is sad, he may tell us.  And in telling us
how things are with him, he uses such sentences as "I see red" or "I have
toothache", "I am thinking of the weather" or "I intend to go to London", just
as in telling us how things are with another he would say "He sees red (has
toothache)" or "He is thinking (intends to go to London)".  In the latter
cases he ascribes experiences (broadly and loosely speaking) to another; so,
in the former cases, it seems, he ascribes experiences to himself.  Hence, we
are inclined to think, he says of the self which is his, that it has certain
experiences.  This is possible, it appears, because he is self-conscious,
aware of the experiences which are the experiences of the self.  In telling us
how things are with him, he refers by means of the pronoun "I" to himself, and
ascribes experiences of which he is aware to the self thus referred to.  The
self seems then to be something which has its seat in the body, although it is
not identical with the body --- it is that of which one is inclined to say
"/Sum res cogitans/" ["I am a thinking thing"], it is the essence of the person.
Awareness or consciousness of the self thus conceived is introspection, a
looking into oneself, a form of perception or "inner sense".  When one
introspects one observes that one's self is in a certain state (e.g. that one
has a headache) or is engaging in a certain activity (e.g. thinking).  One's
observations of what goes on in one's self are privileged, the "inner" is
accessible /directly/ only /to/ the self.  Only he who "has" it, really knows it.
I /know/, with /certainty/, how things are with me, others can only guess.  For I
can perceive what is "inner" whereas others must judge how things are with me
on the basis of my behaviour, i.e., mere externalities.  And much that is
"inner" may remain for ever hidden from others.  But, of course, I may, and
sometimes do, tell them.  My utterances of first-person psychological
sentences thus seem to be reports of how things are with me, /descriptions/ of
"inner" events which I observe /in foro interno/ ["in an internal forum"].

In every respect this picture is misguided.  It correctly notes important
grammatical connections and features of first- and third-person psychological
utterances, and draws the wrong conclusions from them.  It understandably
invokes natural metaphors and similes, and misapplies them.  It rightly
employs an array of ordinary expressions which are used --- differently --- in
different language-games, but it wrongly projects features of their use in one
language-game on to a quite different one in which those features have no
place.  First, it is true and important that if a person avows that he is
having a certain experience or thinking a certain thought, one cannot dispute
his word.  He may be untruthful, lying to us about what he feels or thinks,
but he cannot (with insignificant qualifications) be /mistaken/.  If someone
sincerely says "I have toothache", then (/ceteris paribus/) he does have
toothache, for his saying this is a criterion for it being so.  But the fact
that there is no room for mistake is not because the inner eye enjoys perfect
vision.  It is further true that there is no room for doubt in my own case;
but not because the inner stage is so well lit.  It is also true that another
person can conceal his feelings, dissimulate, pretend, play-act, that often we
cannot say what he is thinking or what he intends unless he tells us.  But
that is not because he is better informed than we.  Nor does the fact that all
this is possible suggest for one moment that we can never really know what
another thinks, feels, or sees.  Secondly, it is natural, when moving within
the ambit of psychological expressions to talk of what is /inner/ and what is
/outer/ (experience and behaviour).  Others know of my experiences from my
behaviour, from what I do and say; I do not.  But it is quite wrong to
construe this metaphor in such a way that suggests that I know of my
experiences from the "inside", by observing them, that I know "directly" in my
own case, but only indirectly in the case of others.  And it is equally
misguided to think that when I reveal my thoughts or feelings to you, I let
you see inside, where hitherto only I saw.  Moreover, it is no better to
intimate that when I banish all pretence I still do not /really/ reveal what is
"inside".  Thirdly, it is certainly true that we talk of observing,
describing, and reporting objects in the room, people, and their behaviour.
It is also true that there is such a thing as observing our own mental states,
describing our experiences, reporting them.  But the latter kinds of
describing are deeply and importantly different from the former, as different
as knowing John is from knowing the alphabet.  It is a cardinal error of the
Cartesian picture to take avowals of experience as descriptions of experience
and to construe descriptions of experience on the model of descriptions of
objects of experience.
#+end_quote

ch. 11.2:
#+begin_quote
Criteria for $q$ verify that $q$ is the case.  If the criteria for $q$ are
/satisfed/, i.e. if $p$ is the case /in these circumstances/, then it is certain
that $q$.  If someone touches a red-hot poker and screams, hugs his burned
hand, etc., then it is certain that he has hurt himself.  "I can be as /certain/
of someone else's sensations as of any fact".  We could perhaps imagine
/different/ circumstances in which this behaviour would be compatible with the
person's not being in pain, but it does not follow that in these circumstances
there could be any intelligible doubt.  "'But, if you are /certain/, isn't it
that you are shutting your eyes in face of doubt?'-'They are shut.'".  Doubt,
in such circumstances, would betoken a failure of understanding, lack of
mastery of the concept of pain, not admirable caution.  Wittgenstein equates
the criteria for seeing with /proofs/ that someone sees.  Again, to say of
someone who moves around the room confidently in daylight, obviously using his
eyes, or of someone who reads a passage aloud from a book in certain
circumstances, that it is only probable that they see would be unintelligible.
Similarly with respect to abilities.  If someone conducts a normal
conversation with us in English, or plays a game of chess, there is no
question but that he understands English and can play chess.  If someone were
to say that understanding or being able to play chess are inner processes,
hidden from view behind their overt manifestations, we should contradict him.
Understanding and abilities are not inner processes at all, although they are
not behaviour either.  We should remind the person "of the /criteria/ which
would prove his capacity to us".

The contemporary concept of a truth-condition is a philosophical and
metaphysical misconception resulting from a distorted view of a pair of
grammatical propositions: first, "It is true that $p$" = "$p$" and secondly,
"The proposition that $p$" = "The proposition made true by the fact that $p$".
The latter triviality is /not/ a statement of the relation between language and
the world or an expression of the metaphysics of "realism" according to which
what is true is true "in virtue of" objective facts-in-the-world.  On the
contrary, it points at the source of the confused thought that there is any
such thing to be said /or denied/.

According to Wittgenstein, meaning /is/ use, not in a metaphorical sense but in
a literal one (alternatively: meaning /logically presupposes/ a use).  Meanings
are erroneously conceived as the cash-value of words, like money and the cow
one can buy with it, but the relation should be viewed as analogous to that of
money and its use.

Some more ChatGPT goodness, prompted by [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uLxFmhYnl0][this explanation]] of Poisson point
processes and exponential distributions (see also: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution][Wikipedia]]).

#+begin_quote
In probability theory and statistics, the exponential distribution, or
negative exponential distribution, is the probability distribution of the time
between events in a Poisson point process, i.e., a process in which events
occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.

Why is this distribution over values of $x$ greater than or equal to zero?  If
it is assumed that two points cannot occur at the same time, then shouldn't
the distribution be undefined at $x = 0$?

#+begin_quote
The exponential distribution is indeed defined for values greater than or
equal to zero, and it is a continuous probability distribution.  The reason
for this is that even though the probability of observing an event exactly at
time zero is theoretically zero, the probability of observing an event within
an infinitesimally small interval around zero is still non-zero.

In probability theory, the probability density function (PDF) describes the
likelihood of a random variable taking on a specific value. For the
exponential distribution, the PDF is given by:

$f(x) = \lambda \cdot e^{-\lambda x}$

Where $\lambda$ is the rate parameter of the distribution.  When $x = 0$, the
PDF evaluates to $f(0) = \lambda$.  Although the value of the PDF at $x = 0$
is non-zero, it represents a point of discontinuity, meaning that the
distribution is not continuous at that specific point.  However, the integral
of the PDF over any interval that includes zero is still well-defined and
yields a meaningful probability.

When we calculate probabilities or expectations involving the exponential
distribution, we usually consider intervals starting from a value greater than
zero.  This is because the exponential distribution is often used to model the
time between events in a Poisson process, where the events are assumed to
occur independently and continuously starting from time zero.  Therefore, the
distribution is typically defined and analyzed for values greater than or
equal to zero.

In summary, while the exponential distribution is technically discontinuous at
$x = 0$, it is still defined for values greater than or equal to zero, and the
probabilities associated with intervals that include zero are well-defined.

A metaphor for the acquisition of knowledge:

- making a straight-line advance toward the city = progress

  - feels harder, as we're standing still now, not advancing

    obstacle; we know exactly what needs to be done to progress
- strafing = we're stuck, so try another tack
  - the current fight feels /too/ hard, we are flailing, we should come at this
    from another angle, seek other resources that explain things in an
    alternative set of words, or try to shore up our knowledge in adjacent
    areas
- siege warfare = accepting that the goal will take many months or even years
  to reach
  - a major investment of time is required (time = money)
- retreat = coming back to the problem later
  - this can be hard to accept, getting up to speed again at a later time will
    have an additional cost, supposing we can find the will to get back on the
    horse

With regard to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems][incompleteness of logic]], I was curious as to what it means
for something to be "true but unprovable", which led me to the discussions
[[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3338958/what-does-it-mean-for-something-to-be-true-but-unprovable][here]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/56bbd3/what_does_it_mean_for_something_to_be_true_but/][here]].

This seems to relate to the difference between syntax and semantics.  Syntax
concerns formal proofs; what is "provable", i.e. with respect to a particular
set of axioms.  Semantics concerns structure and what lacks counter-examples
or contradictions; what is "true", i.e. with respect to a particular
structure.  In the former, we derive the proposition from the axioms; in the
latter, we take the proposition to be true in advance as part of the model (or
"interpretation").

The example given:
#+begin_quote
Raymond Smullyan likes to frame this problem as an accurate and consistent
logician who doesn't know that he is accurate or consistent visiting one of
those islands where some of the people always tell the truth and the rest
always lie.  Imagine a native coming up to the logician and saying "You will
never be able to prove that I am a truth-teller".

You and I looking at this problem can tell that the native is a truth-teller
--- if he were a liar, then the logician would be able to prove that he was a
truth-teller, which violates his accuracy. But from the logician's
perspective, he will remain undecided about the native's reliability, because
he doesn't have the perspective to know his own accuracy.

So, as far as provability goes, the reasoner's logic is like the axioms of a
particular logical system, and our logic is like the axioms of a meta-system
that is able to prove things about the simple system that it can not prove
about itself.

If we assume that the uttered G√∂del sentence is true (an assumption that is
made /outside/ the system), we can't go on to prove it.  If we instead assume
that the sentence is false, then we can't prove its negation.

Another interesting discussion I found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/13win2m/in_line_with_rogers_penrose_argumentation_why_is/jmcss8i/][here]].  I interpret this to be saying
that, were the mind taken to be something governed by a formal system, then
this system would be one that short-circuits its evaluation of propositions
--- should it be capable of performing recursion, it would not be the same
sort of recursion that a formal system performs.

What lessons did the allies learn from the handling of Germany in the
aftermath of World War 1 and the rise of Nazism, and what did they do
differently in the aftermath of World War 2 to ensure that those mistakes were
not repeated?
#+end_quote

ChatGPT:
#+begin_quote
The Allies learned several lessons from the handling of Germany after World
War I and the rise of Nazism.  These lessons influenced their approach to
post-World War II Germany to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past:
- Harsh Treaty of Versailles :: The Allies realized that imposing excessively
  punitive terms on Germany, as done in the Treaty of Versailles after World
  War I, can breed resentment and economic instability.  They aimed to create
  a more balanced and fair peace settlement after World War II.
- Economic Stability and Rebuilding :: The Allies recognized the importance of
  promoting economic stability and assisting in the rebuilding of Germany.
  They understood that economic hardship could contribute to political
  instability and extremist movements.  Initiatives like the Marshall Plan
  were implemented to support the recovery and reconstruction of war-torn
  nations, including Germany.
- Democratization and Denazification :: The Allies understood the need to
  dismantle the Nazi regime and promote democracy in Germany.  They conducted
  extensive denazification programs to remove Nazi influence from various
  spheres of society.  Additionally, they implemented democratic reforms,
  including free elections and the establishment of a parliamentary system.
- Occupation and Division :: In contrast to the lack of a unified and coherent
  occupation strategy after World War I, the Allies established a
  comprehensive occupation plan for Germany after World War II.  Germany was
  divided into four zones controlled by the United States, the Soviet Union,
  Britain, and France.  Each zone had a distinct approach to occupation, but
  the Allies maintained coordination and cooperation to ensure stability and
  prevent a resurgence of Nazism.
- Focus on Education and Re-education :: The Allies prioritized education and
  re-education programs to counter Nazi ideology and promote democratic
  values.  They implemented curriculum reforms, conducted propaganda
  campaigns, and supported initiatives aimed at fostering a democratic mindset
  among the German population.

Overall, the Allies learned from the mistakes of the post-World War I era and
adopted a more comprehensive and thoughtful approach in the aftermath of World
War II.  They sought to address the root causes of extremism, promote
democracy, rebuild Germany's economy, and establish a cooperative occupation
strategy to ensure lasting peace.

Two illuminating maxims about math I learned this week:

#+begin_verse
/Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things/.[fn::Courtesy of Henry Poincar√©.]
#+end_verse

This phrase emphasises the importance of assigning a single, unified name to a
concept that can be expressed in a variety of ways.  This helps to simplify
the language of mathematics, making it easier to communicate, understand, and
work with.  It also helps to create a unified language that mathematicians can
use to discuss and compare different concepts, regardless of how they are
expressed.  For example: complex numbers of the form $r + 0i$ are synonyms for
the ordinary real numbers $r$ with respect to the normal rules of combination.
Specifically, $r + 0i$ plus $s + 0i$ equals $(r+s) + 0i$, while $r + 0i$ times
$s + 0i$ equals $(rs) + 0i$.  There just so happens to be a whole 'nother
edifice on top of them.


#+begin_verse
/Mathematics is the art of giving different names to the same thing/.[fn::Courtesy of [[https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2023/02/17/things-names-and-numbers/][James Propp]].]
#+end_verse

For example, things like real numbers can be expressed in multiple ways
(e.g. as infinite "Cauchy sequences" of rational numbers).  Having multiple
names for points on the real number line means we can use whichever naming
system is best for the task at hand.  The modest price we pay for having more
Names than Things is that we have to specify when two names name the same
thing.  For instance, in the case of fractions, we have a rule that says that
the fractions $a/b$ and $c/d$ are different names for the same number when $ad
= bc$ (and that they represent different numbers otherwise).  In the case of
irrational numbers, two sequences represent the same thing if they provably
always get closer together the further you extend them out.  This is
reminiscent of the Tractatus, and the notion that logic is merely giving
different names for the same thing: tautology.

Both Euler's approach to $1+2+3+4+\ldots$ and Ramanujan's approach start from
the idea that you shouldn't think about that particular numerical expression
in isolation; you should think of it as the value taken on by some function
$f(x)$ for some particular value of $x$.  But which function?  And which
particular value?  There's the rub.  Euler treated $1+2+3+4+\ldots$ as the
value associated with the function $1+2x+3x^{2}+4x^{3}+\ldots$ at $x = 1$, and
(after algebraic extrapolation) got the answer $\infty$.  Ramanujan and Hardy
and Littlewood treated $1+2+3+4+\ldots$ as the value associated with the
function $1^{x}+2^{x}+3^{x}+4^{x}+\ldots$ at $x = 1$, and (after analytic
continuation) got the answer $-1/12$. [This last equation is akin to the
solution to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function][Reimann zeta function]] at $-1$, i.e. $\zeta(-1) =
-\frac{1}{12}$.]

Another treatise on [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MG8Yhsxqu9JY4xRPr/mental-context-for-model-theory#The_Right_to_use_a_name][names in mathematics]]:
#+begin_quote
Many math textbooks treat properties that justify a name of a thing as
statements about the thing after naming it.

This is a little abstract, so I'll make a silly example.  Imagine someone is
trying to show that, in category theory, composition of arrows is associative.
They shouldn't appeal to visual intuition or any diagrams of arrows.

The concept that following arrows is an associative operation is so ingrained
in the concept of "arrow" that it's difficult to describe the property in
English without sounding dumb:
#+begin_verse
/If you move from A to B, then move B-to-D-through-C in one step, and if I follow the same paths but move A-to-C-through-B in one step and then from C to D, then we will end up at the same place./
#+end_verse

This property of arrows is so stupidly obvious that the statement is
frustrating. Further, it hides the following fact:
#+begin_verse
/Associative composition between thingies is something we must have before we're justified in calling the thingies "Arrows"./
#+end_verse

Associative composition is what allows you to use the name "arrow" and draw
visual diagrams.  You can't appeal to my intuition about "arrows" to show that
composition is associative.  It's the other way around! Only after you show
that your thingies have associative composition are you allowed to label them
as "arrows".

[...]

I imagine this is not a problem for experienced mathematicians, for whom it
goes without saying that you must formally specify (or disregard) all
intuitive baggage that comes attached to the names.  However, I remember
distinctly a number of times when I gnashed my teeth with boredom as teachers
made obvious statements (of course ‚â§ is reflexive, why do we even need to say
this?), simply because I didn't understand this idea.

I mention this because the first few sections of the /Model Theory/ textbook
make statements that seem quite obvious.  It's easy to grind your teeth and
say "duh, hurry up".  It's a little harder to understand exactly why such
things must be said.  In that light, I think this is a good piece of advice
for learning mathematics in general:
#+begin_verse
/If you find yourself wondering why a statement must be said, check whether the statement is justifying any names./
#+end_verse

[...]

The early parts of /Model Theory/ will go down much easier if you realize that
they're binding logical symbols to the appropriate meaning (and thus
justifying the name "model").

For example, when we state "$\mathcal{M}$ models $\varphi \land \psi$ if and
only if it models $\varphi$ and it models $\psi$", it's easy to say "well
duh".  It's a little harder to understand that this is the mechanism by which
the symbol $\land$ is bound to the interpretation "and".

A random collation of Nietzsche quotes:

/D/, I.50:
#+begin_quote
Men who enjoy moments of exaltation and ecstasy and who, on account of the
contrast other states present and because of the way they have squandered
their nervous energy, are ordinarily in a wretched and miserable condition,
regard these moments as their real "self" and their wretchedness and misery as
the /effect of what is 'outside the self'/; and thus they harbour feelings of
revengefulness towards their environment, their age, their entire world.
Intoxication counts as their real life, as their actual ego: they see in
everything else the opponent and obstructor of intoxication, no matter whether
its nature be spiritual, moral, religious or artistic.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
We laugh at him who steps out of his room at the moment when the sun steps out
of its room, and then says: "I will that the sun shall rise"; and at him who
cannot stop a wheel, and says: "I will that it shall roll"; and at him who is
thrown down in wrestling, and says: "here I lie, but I will lie here!"  But,
all laughter aside, are we ourselves ever acting any differently whenever we
employ the expression: "/I will/"?

/Star friendship/. --- We were friends and have become estranged.  But this was
right, and we do not want to conceal and obscure it from ourselves as if we
had reason to feel ashamed.  We are two ships each of which has its goal and
course; our paths may cross and we may celebrate a feast together, as we did
--- and then the good ships rested so quietly in one harbor and one sunshine
that it may have looked as if they had reached their goal and as if they had
one goal.  But then the almighty force of our tasks drove us apart again into
different seas and sunny zones, and perhaps we shall never see one another
again; perhaps we shall meet again but fail to recognize each other --- our
exposure to different seas and suns has changed us!  That we have to become
estranged is the law /above/ us: by the same token we should also become more
venerable for each other!  And thus the memory of our former friendship should
become more sacred!  There is probably a tremendous but invisible stellar
orbit in which our very different ways and goals may be /included/ as small
parts of this path; let us rise up to this thought!  But our life is too short
and our power of vision too small for us to be more than friends in the sense
of this sublime possibility. --- Let us then /believe/ in our star friendship

#+begin_quote
/How we, too, are still pious/. --- In science convictions have no rights of
citizenship, as one says with good reason.  Only when they decide to descend
to the modesty of hypotheses, of a provisional experimental point of view, of
a regulative fiction, they may be granted admission and even a certain value
in the realm of knowledge --- though always with the restriction that they
remain under police supervision, under the police of mistrust. --- But does
this not mean, if you consider it more precisely, that a conviction may obtain
admission to science only when it /ceases/ to be a conviction?  Would it not be
the first step in the discipline of the scientific spirit that one would not
permit oneself any more convictions?

Probably this is so; only we still have to ask: /To make it possible for this
discipline to begin/, must there not be some prior conviction --- even one that
is so commanding and unconditional that it sacrifices all other convictions to
itself?  We see that science also rests on a faith; there simply is no science
"without presuppositions."  The question whether /truth/ is needed must not only
have been affirmed in advance, but affirmed to such a degree that the
principle, the faith, the conviction finds expression: "/Nothing/ is needed /more/
than truth, and in relation to it everything else has only second-rate value."

This unconditional will to truth --- what is it?  Is it the will /not to allow
oneself to be deceived/?  Or is it the will /not to deceive/?  For the will to
truth could be interpreted in the second way, too --- if only the special case
"I do not want to deceive myself" is subsumed under the generalization "I do
not want to deceive."  But why not deceive?  But why not allow oneself to be
deceived?

Note that the reasons for the former principle belong to an altogether
different realm from those for the second.  One does not want to allow oneself
to be deceived because one assumes that it is harmful, dangerous, calamitous
to be deceived.  In this sense, science would be a long-range prudence, a
caution, a utility; but one could object in all fairness: How is that?  Is
wanting not to allow oneself to be deceived really less harmful, less
dangerous, less calamitous?  What do you know in advance of the character of
existence to be able to decide whether the greater advantage is on the side of
the unconditionally mistrustful or of the unconditionally trusting?  But if
both should be required, much trust /as well as/ much mistrust, from where would
science then be permitted to take its unconditional faith or conviction on
which it rests, that truth is more important than any other thing, including
every other conviction.  Precisely this conviction could never have come into
being if both truth and untruth constantly proved to be useful, which is the
case.  Thus --- the faith in science, which after all exists undeniably,
cannot owe its origin to such a calculus of utility; it must have originated
in /spite/ of the fact that the disutility and dangerousness of "the will to
truth," of "truth at any price" is proved to it constantly.  "At any price":
how well we understand these words once we have offered and slaughtered one
faith after another on this altar!

Consequently, "will to truth" does /not/ mean "I will not allow myself to be
deceived" but --- there is no alternative --- "I will not deceive, not even
myself"; /and with that we stand on moral ground/.  For you only have to ask
yourself carefully, "Why do you not want to deceive?" especially if it should
seem --- and it does seem! --- as if life aimed at semblance, meaning error,
deception, simulation, delusion, self-delusion, and when the great sweep of
life has actually always shown itself to be on the side of the most scrupulous
/polytropoi/ [Greek word used in the first line of the /Odyssey/ to describe
Odysseus; meaning ranges from much turned to much traveled, versatile, wily,
and manifold].  Charitably interpreted, such a resolve might perhaps be a
quixotism, a minor slightly mad enthusiasm; but it might also be something
more serious, namely, a principle that is hostile to life and destructive. ---
"Will to truth" --- that might be a concealed will to death.

Thus the question "Why science?" leads back to the moral problem: /Why have
morality at all/ when life, nature, and history are "not moral"?  No doubt,
those who are truthful in that audacious and ultimate sense that is
presupposed by the faith in science /thus affirm another world/ than the world
of life, nature, and history; and insofar as they affirm this "other world"
--- look, must they not by the same token negate its counterpart, this world,
/our/ world? --- But you will have gathered what I am driving at, namely, that
it is still a /metaphysical faith/ upon which our faith in science rests ---
that even we seekers after knowledge today, we godless anti-metaphysicians
still take our fire, too, from the flame lit by a faith that is thousands of
years old, that Christian faith which was also the faith of Plato, that God is
the truth, that truth is divine. --- But what if this should become more and
more incredible, if nothing should prove to be divine any more unless it were
error, blindness, the lie --- if God himself should prove to be our most
enduring lie? ---

(I've been adding to this list for ages, including stuff from a couple of

validating knowing that others might have had the exact same thoughts.)
